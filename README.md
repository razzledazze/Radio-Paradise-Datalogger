# Radio-Paradise-Datalogger
Scrapes the Radio Paradise internet radio website to get the current song and artist, then saves each new song to the CSV log file.

This program is for logging changes in website data, and could easily be adapted to log any value in any website,
for example adding a timestamp and having it log a subscriber count from YouTube along with the time it changed.
